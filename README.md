See it live on Netlify here: [Deployed Netlify Site](https://github.com/Borghese-Gladiator/recipe-sharing-site)

## Key Features

* Intuitive UI (similar to AllRecipes)
  - enables users to browse community recipes
  - enables users to post recipes
  - enables users to see their posts in their dashboard
  - enables users to their preferred language
* Internationalization
  - Engineered software and rewrote components to enable multi-language support and components are not fixed with English values
  - Localization - used i18n to change languages on the page with minimum rerenders
  - Stored recipe data and translate prior to serving, so the client-side performance will not suffer
* Personalization
  - Includes user authentication so food browsing can be personalized based on history
  - Users can edit history to change it to their preferences and remove recipes they didn't like

## Installation
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
